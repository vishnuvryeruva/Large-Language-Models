# Large-Language-Models
Describing power of Lage Language Models and its auto text generation

LLM is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning model typically (and for now, exclusively) built using a deep learning approach known as a transformer. knowing itâ€™s a large, complex neural networking approach that is capable of producing extremely sophisticated language-based machine learning models is good enough. From the best available LLM models to choose from open source and to avoid licensing constraints, I picked up BLOOM.\
BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale. The only constraint we have to focus on is transformers package hre as this won't be preinstalled for us
